## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server – Learning Summary

Through hands-on exploration of Model Context Protocol (MCP), I learned how AI systems can maintain structured, consistent context while interacting with external tools and data sources.

I worked on understanding how an MCP server exposes resources, tools, and prompts in a standardized way, allowing Large Language Models (LLMs) to access information safely and predictably. This helped me learn the difference between raw prompt-based interactions and context-aware AI workflows.

I also explored how MCP improves modularity by separating context management from application logic, making AI systems more maintainable and scalable. This experience gave me practical insight into building AI-assisted applications that rely on structured context rather than ad-hoc prompt passing.
